## Programming Languages

Each branch is related to the programming language used to solve the problem. If
some solution is not here, maybe it's solved in another language or not solved
at all.

## Running

To run the solution of a day, enter a command with the following format:

```bash
go run [year]/[day]/main.go
```

For example, running the solution of the first day of 2015 edition would be like

```bash
go run 2015/day01/main.go
```
