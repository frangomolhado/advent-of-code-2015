## Programming Languages

Each branch is related to the programming language used to solve the problem. If
some solution is not here, maybe it's solved in another language or not solved
at all.

## Running

To run the solution of a day, enter its year folder and use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin day[number]
```

For example, running the solution of the first day of 2015 edition would be like

```bash
$ cd 2015
$ cargo run --bin day01
```
